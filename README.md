# Business Understanding
In a data-driven world, businesses aim to personalize user experiences to boost engagement, satisfaction, and revenue. For a movie streaming platform, a recommendation system can provide tailored suggestions based on user preferences and behavior. This project focuses on building a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and a hybrid model to enhance recommendation quality and precision, ultimately improving user experience and platform engagement.

Business Question:
How can we build a recommendation system to provide personalized movie suggestions to users, improving engagement and satisfaction?
# Problem Statement
The movie streaming platform needs a recommendation system to:

-Develop a robust recommendation system that utilizes user and item interactions (ratings) and metadata (genres) to predict user preferences and generate personalized movie recommendations.

-Enhance customer satisfaction and retention by providing personalized movie suggestions.

-Increase user engagement, conversion rates, and platform revenue.

-Address the "cold start problem" for new users and movies with limited interaction data.

-Overcome the limitations of current recommendation methods in capturing the dynamics between users and movies, ensuring recommendations are relevant and diverse. The system must balance accuracy, scalability, and real-time processing to deliver seamless recommendations
# Objectives
Collaborative Filtering: Develop a model that recommends movies based on user-item interactions, such as ratings and viewing history.

-Matrix Factorization: Apply techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to uncover latent factors in user-movie relationships, improving predictions.

-Hybrid Model: Combine collaborative filtering and matrix factorization to leverage the strengths of both approaches, improving recommendation accuracy and coverage.

-Cold Start Problem: Address challenges of recommending movies to new users and suggesting newly added movies with limited data. -Performance Optimization: Ensure the system is scalable and capable of providing real-time, personalized recommendations.

-Model Evaluation: Measure and compare model effectiveness using precision, recall, Accuracy and NDCG to evaluate the accuracy of the recommendations
# Success Criteria
-Improved Accuracy: The hybrid model should outperform collaborative filtering and matrix factorization methods in terms of precision, recall, and user satisfaction.

-Cold Start Handling: The system should offer meaningful recommendations for new users and movies with minimal performance drop.

-Scalability: The recommendation system must scale efficiently as the platform grows, ensuring responsiveness even as the number of users and movies increases.

-Increased Engagement: There should be a measurable increase in user interactions with recommended movies (e.g., views, ratings, or watch time).

-Business Impact: The system should contribute to key business metrics such as increased subscriptions, user retention, and overall revenue.

# Reasons and Importance of Models
## Collaborative Filtering:
-Reason: Collaborative filtering leverages historical user-item interactions (e.g., ratings, watch history) to make personalized recommendations.

-Importance: It helps identify similar users and suggests movies based on what others with similar tastes have liked, improving user satisfaction and engagement.

### Matrix Factorization:
-Reason: Matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) decompose the user-movie interaction matrix into latent factors, revealing hidden relationships between users and movies.

-Importance: It enables the system to make better predictions, especially in sparse datasets (where many user-movie interactions are missing), enhancing recommendation accuracy.`

####  Hybrid Model:
-Reason: A hybrid model combines the strengths of both collaborative filtering and matrix factorization to overcome their individual weaknesses, such as the cold start problem in collaborative filtering.

-Importance: Hybrid models improve recommendation robustness by integrating multiple techniques, ensuring more diverse and accurate movie recommendations across different user profiles.

By utilizing these models, the movie recommender system will be more effective, engaging, and scalable, ultimately leading to a better user experience and helping the platform achieve its key business goals

# Data Cleaning
Missing values and duplicated rows are handled. Also, columns irrelevant to the project are dropped. Formatting of columns and their contents for smooth analysis.
# Data Merging
Â¶
-ratings and movies, is merged on the movieId column using an inner join.

-An inner join was used to merge the two DataFrames based on movieId, ensuring only movies that have both ratings and metadata (title/genres) are included, excluding entries with missing data in either DataFrame.

-Shape: The resulting DataFrame has 100,836 entries and 6 columns.

-Columns: contains columns: userId, movieId, rating, timestamp, title, and genres.

-Data Types: The columns contain data types: int64 for identifiers, float64 for ratings, and object for movie title and genres.

-Summary Statistics: Basic descriptive statistics show mean ratings of 3.5, with a rating range from 0.5 to 5.

-Value Counts: 100,836 entries, each representing a unique rating event, with a mix of ratings across various movies and genres.

-Unique Entries: The data includes various combinations of userId, movieId, rating, and timestamp for different movies, showing no duplicates or repeated entries.

Reason: It has the lowest RMSE and MAE among the models, indicating better predictive accuracy. It also has a higher precision compared to UBCF and IBCF, suggesting that it provides more relevant recommendations.
Advantages: It effectively handles sparsity and scales well with large datasets, making it suitable for real-world applications.
Consider UBCF for Specific Use Cases: If user data is abundant and the system can afford to handle the cold start problem, UBCF can be a good choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness in personalized recommendations.

# Hybrid Movie Recommendations
The hybrid recommendation system effectively combines collaborative and content-based filtering to deliver personalized movie recommendations by leveraging user preferences and movie attributes. Observations reveal that the system performs well in predicting ratings, with reasonable RMSE values indicating accurate estimations of user preferences. Metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score demonstrate the model's ability to recommend relevant movies, while the confusion matrix highlights its effectiveness in distinguishing between relevant and non-relevant films. The balanced hybrid approach ensures that both user behavior and movie content contribute to predictions, resulting in a system that provides diverse and tailored recommendations. These findings suggest that hybrid models can outperform standalone methods, offering a practical solution for personalized recommendation systems.
